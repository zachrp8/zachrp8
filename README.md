- 👋 Hi, I’m @zachrp8
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Development. Frontend Web Development is also interesting to me, but I just do not know enough about it currently.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SQL, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects to gain experience in the different fields and gain an idea of what I would like to do in the future.
- 📫 You can reach me at zparkhurst11@gmail.com
